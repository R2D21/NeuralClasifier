The main technical ideas behind how these parsers work appear in these
papers.  Feel free to cite one or more of the following papers depending on what you
are using.  Since the parser is regularly updated, we appreciate it if
papers with numerical results reflecting parser performance mention the
version of the parser being used.
The parser can read various forms of plain text input and can output
various analysis formats, including part-of-speech tagged text, phrase
structure trees, and a grammatical relations (typed dependency) format.
For example, consider the text:

The following output shows
part-of-speech tagged text, then a context-free phrase structure grammar
representation, and finally a typed dependency representation. All of
these are different views of the output of the parser.
