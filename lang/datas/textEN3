## NOTES ##
-----------
- The library is free to use for any kind of use (including commercial use)
- The usage of this library is only in responsibility of the user
- The author of this library is not responsible for any situation that the usage of this library could lead to - the usage is on your own risk


## BACKGROUND ##
----------------
- This library was developed in Linux and was tested with GCC 4.8.2
- Starting from version from December 2015, it was tested also with Microsoft VC++ 2010 (Should also work on newer versions)


## INCLUDED MODULES ##
----------------------
- This library contains 3 modules:
    - FeedForward Network
        - Perceptron
	    - Neuron

- The "Neuron" module is a dependency for both of "FeedForward Network" and "Perceptron"


## INCLUDED EXAMPLES ##
-----------------------
This library contains one Perceptron example and one FeedForward Network example


## API DOCUMENTATION ##
-----------------------
- Currently the API documentation is only available inside the "*.h" files, inside the "include" directory
- An HTML-based documentation will be added in the future

## COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO ##
----------------------------------------------------------
* Step 1: Extract the archive. A library root directory named "freeNN" will be created.
* Step 2: In your existing Visual C++ project, go to Solution Explorer -> Right click on your project header in the tree -> Properties
           - In the tree on the left go to Configuration Properties -> VC++ Directories
	              - Click on "Include Directories" in the table on the right. A little arrow will appear on the right, click on the arrow and "Edit"
		                 - Add a new line with path to the "include" directory, which is found in the library root
				 * Step 3: In your existing Visual C++ project, go to Solution Explorer -> Right click on "Source Files" in the project's tree -> Add -> Existing Item
				            - Add all the files from the "src" directory, which is found in the library root
					    * Step 4: (Optional) If you want to run an example, repeat step 3 with a file from the "examples" directory, which is found in the library root
					    * Step 5: Build the solution


## COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR GCC IN LINUX ##
-----------------------------------------------

* Step 1 - Creating a shared library: (Skip this step if you plan to use the library only statically)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    unzip freeNN
      cd freeNN
        mkdir lib
	  gcc -fpic -shared src/*.c -lm -Iinclude -o lib/libfreenn.so

* Step 2 - Compiling the usage examples:
  --------------------------------------
    mkdir bin

  ** Option 1 - Compile statically **
    -----------------------------------
      gcc examples/perceptron_example.c src/perceptron.c src/neuron.c -lm -Iinclude -o bin/perceptron_example_static
        gcc examples/ffnet_example.c src/feedforwardnetwork.c src/neuron.c -lm -Iinclude -o bin/ffnet_example_static

  ** Option 2 - Compile dynamically (Using the shared library from Step 1) **
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      gcc examples/perceptron_example.c -Llib -lfreenn -lm -Iinclude -o bin/perceptron_example_dynamic
        gcc examples/ffnet_example.c -Llib -lfreenn -lm -Iinclude -o bin/ffnet_example_dynamic

   - Note: To run the dynamically compiled binaries, the "lib" directory from step 1 has to be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
