If an ANN is to be able to learn a problem, it must
be defi ned as a function with a set of input and output variables supported by examples of how this
function should work.A problem like the XOR func-
tion is already defi ned as a function with two bina-
ry input variables and a binary output variable, and
with the examples which are defi ned by the results of
four different input patterns.
