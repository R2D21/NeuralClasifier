A natural language parser is a program that works out the grammatical

This package is a Java implementation of probabilistic natural language
parsers, 
both highly optimized PCFG and lexicalized dependency parsers, and a
lexicalized PCFG parser. 
The lexicalized probabilistic parser implements a factored product
	model, with separate PCFG 
    phrase structure and lexical dependency experts, whose preferences
    are combined by efficient exact inference, using an A* algorithm.
Or the software can be used simply as an accurate unlexicalized stochastic
context-free grammar parser.
Either of these yields a good performance statistical parsing system.
A GUI is provided for viewing the phrase structure tree output of the parser.
